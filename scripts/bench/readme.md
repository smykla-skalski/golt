# Benchmarks

## Developer workflow benchmark (CI only)

Push branch `perf/local-workflow` to run the `Performance benchmark` workflow's
`local-workflow` job. It builds golt on GitHub Actions, clones the pinned small
workload, seeds the Go cache, and compares three repeated editor-like requests
under these policies:

| Case | Policy tested |
| --- | --- |
| `serial` | One request at a time, two Go CPUs each. |
| `parallel` | Three overlapping requests, two Go CPUs each. |
| `bounded` | Two overlapping requests, one Go CPU each. |
| `fork_gc` | Bounded overlap with golt's default GC policy. |
| `daemon` | Serial requests through the existing warm daemon. |
| `supersede` | Terminate a stale request before the next starts. |
| `split` | Run govet, staticcheck, and unused in separate processes. |

The job records each request's wall time, exit code, normalized diagnostic hash,
process-tree peak RSS, batch makespan, and aggregate peak RSS. It rejects changed
diagnostics and enforces a 3 GiB aggregate RSS ceiling. All linter workloads run
on CI; local checks of the harness should be syntax and configuration checks.
Each case also publishes its median makespan and maximum aggregate RSS as a
commit status so results remain readable without downloading an Actions artifact.
The bounded case simulates shared admission; it does not add admission to the
product. The supersede case measures process cancellation, not analyzer context
propagation. Daemon RSS excludes its detached server process.

The script use [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) to benchmark the command line of golangci-lint.

## Reproducible baseline

Build the fork and run the pinned workload matrix:

```bash
make bench_baseline
```

The default matrix measures cold and warm golangci-lint caches with 1, 2, 4,
and 8-way concurrency. It pins child processes to the manifest's Go toolchain
and keeps the Go build and module caches warm. Results, logs, cloned workloads,
and optional profiles stay under ignored `dist/bench/`.

Every golangci-lint process runs at niceness 10 with `GOMAXPROCS=2`, Go build
parallelism 2, a 2 GiB Go memory limit, a 2 GiB process-tree RSS kill threshold,
and a five-minute hard timeout. The limits are recorded in `metadata.json` and
can be tightened with `--nice`, `--go-max-procs`, `--max-rss-mib`, and
`--run-timeout`.

The large Kuma workload targets a pinned 81-file, 29.7k-line generated API
subset with test analysis disabled. Whole-repository Kuma runs exceed the safe
local resource budget.

Benchmark processes also use golangci-lint's serial-runner lock. They wait
instead of overlapping another local golangci-lint process.

Run a quick smoke benchmark:

```bash
make bench_baseline BENCH_ARGS='--workload small --scenario goanalysis --concurrency 1 --runs 1'
```

When local host load makes wall-time measurements unreliable, run the manual
`Performance benchmark` GitHub Actions workflow. It builds explicit candidate
and baseline refs, runs seven cold samples in both binary orders under two CPUs
and a 1 GiB limit, and uploads raw results plus optional CPU, heap, and trace
profiles. Binary labels remain stable when the execution order reverses. The
workflow builds the exact requested baseline ref; the default refs compare the
checked-out commit with its parent.

The manifest includes focused `govet`, `staticcheck`, `unused`, and
`staticcheck-unused` scenarios. Compare them with the combined `goanalysis`
scenario to isolate fact-cache and shared-IR costs:

```bash
make bench_baseline BENCH_ARGS='--workload large --scenario staticcheck-unused --concurrency 4'
```

Select one module from a multi-module workload with an exact path filter:

```bash
make bench_baseline BENCH_ARGS='--workload multi-module --module scripts/gen_github_action_config --concurrency 1,2,4,8'
```

Capture profiles separately from timing samples:

```bash
make bench_baseline BENCH_ARGS='--profiles'
```

Heap profiles use a 64 KiB allocation sample rate to keep profiling overhead
practical. Profile runs never contribute timing samples.

Compare another binary built from the same source base:

```bash
make bench_baseline UPSTREAM_BIN=/absolute/path/to/upstream/golangci-lint
```

Artifacts:

- `metadata.json`: host, toolchain, binary hashes, workload revisions, config hashes.
- `results.jsonl`: one durable record per completed run.
- `logs/`: verbose golangci-lint output.
- `profiles/`: CPU, heap, and runtime trace captures.

Compare JSON diagnostics from reference and candidate binaries:

```bash
GOMAXPROCS=2 GOFLAGS=-p=2 mise exec go@1.26.0 -- \
  make bench_compat \
  BENCH_ARGS='--workload small --scenario goanalysis --concurrency 1'
```

Compatibility mode requires both binaries plus explicit workload and
concurrency filters. It executes upstream then fork sequentially with isolated
cold caches. The comparator normalizes the workload root, sorts diagnostics
and report metadata, compares exit codes, and writes raw and normalized outputs
plus a JSON summary under `compat/`.

Scenarios marked `mutates` run in separate clean detached worktrees. The
comparator also checks deterministic manifests of added, modified, and deleted
files, including modes, symlinks, and binary content. Matching worktrees are
removed; mismatching worktrees are retained and recorded in `summary.json`.

`bench_compat` builds the candidate from `HEAD` and the reference from its merge
base with `upstream/main`, both in clean detached worktrees. Builds are
sequential and capped at two-way Go parallelism, a 1 GiB Go memory limit,
niceness 10, and five minutes. `dist/bench/bin/pair.json` records resolved refs,
commits, binary hashes, and limits. Override refs with `BENCH_CANDIDATE_REF` and
`BENCH_UPSTREAM_REF`.

Run the pinned directive compatibility corpus:

```bash
GOMAXPROCS=2 GOFLAGS=-p=2 mise exec go@1.26.0 -- make bench_compat_corpus
```

The corpus covers diagnostics, custom configuration, fix mode, compile errors,
cgo, path exclusions, test inclusion, internal timeout, external cancellation,
two simultaneous shared-cache runners, and corrupted-cache recovery. Interrupted
cases compare exit and termination outcomes without inventing an empty JSON
report; every case rejects surviving child processes. Each case selects its own
working directory and package inside a pinned checkout. Restrict a smoke run
with `BENCH_CORPUS_SCENARIO=cancellation`. The target always compares at
concurrency 1 with a two-minute timeout, at most two linter processes, two Go
CPUs per process, niceness 10, and a 1 GiB per-process RSS ceiling.

For the multi-module workload, always select a module. Do not run its root above
concurrency 1 under a 1 GiB RSS limit:

```bash
GOMAXPROCS=2 GOFLAGS=-p=2 mise exec go@1.26.0 -- \
  make bench_compat \
  BENCH_ARGS='--workload multi-module --module scripts/gen_github_action_config --scenario goanalysis --concurrency 1'
```

Use `make bench_compare` only to compare JSON files captured separately.

## Benchmark one linter: with a local version

```bash
make bench_local LINTER=gosec VERSION=v1.59.0
```

## Benchmark one linter: between 2 existing versions

```bash
make bench_version LINTER=gosec VERSION_OLD=v1.58.1 VERSION_NEW=v1.59.0 
```
